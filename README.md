### About me
*Ever since I was a child, the curiosity has always driven me to explore everything around. Learning something new when reading books or watching documentaries always make me excited and fascinated. As i grew up, my attention shifted towards the field of technology, including computers, softwares and data. Humankind has gone through thousands of years of exploring, discovering and inventing to achieve what we have to day. Now, those knowledge exists right in front of my eyes, with all its novelty, so attractive and inviting, like a child in a toy store. 🧸🪀*
